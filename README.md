## This was my third homework for my Trilogy labs week 3 Java Script. 

I was to create a a daily planner that meets the below requirements.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

```
WHEN I open the planner
```

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

```
WHEN I scroll down
```

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

```
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
```

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

```
WHEN I click into a timeblock
```

THEN I can enter an event

```
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
```

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage


```
WHEN I refresh the page
```

THEN the saved events persist


To accomplish this I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Moments, and bootstrap. There was some base HTML and CSS code provided by Triliogy for us to work from as this was mainly a javaScript homework.
